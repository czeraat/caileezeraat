<p>I am a senior at Fordham University currently working towards my BA in English Language and Literature with the intent to attend law school following graduation. 
I primarily enjoy studying linguistics and literature, focusing on the discrimination towards minority groups through coded language and narratives. I am also working towards fluency in Spanish.</p>
<p>I serve as the Copy Chief at The Fordham Ram, Fordham's leading student publication, and Vice President of Sigma Tau Delta, the English Honor Society.
Outside of working hours, I play the upright bass in the university orchestra, lift in the gym, and play competitive online video games.</p>
