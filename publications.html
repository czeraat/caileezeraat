<h1>Publications</h1>
<p>My articles have been published in both
<a href="https://thefordhamram.com/staff_name/cailee-zeraat/">The Fordham Ram</a> and 
<a href="https://observer.case.edu/staff_name/cailee-zeraat/">The Observer</a>.
I mainly write for the opinion section. However, my contributions to the Ram mostly lie in
my role as Copy Chief, where I edit the 40-50 articles submitted each week multiple times
before they get sent to print. So, while my name not be on every single article, I consider
the edits I make to these articles notable additions to my porfolio.</p>
