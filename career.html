<h1>Career</h1>

<p> 
Following the completion of my BA, I plan to work in either the journalism or publishing industry for a few years. 
After this experience, I will attend law school and seek a long-term career as a lawyer. Much of my experience thus far
has been in the field of journalism; however, I am also seeking experience in the legal field prior to attending 
law school.
